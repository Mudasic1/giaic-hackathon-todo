# Project Constitution: Todo In-Memory Python Console App

## Purpose
To build a foundational command-line Todo application using strictly Spec-Driven Development (SDD). The goal is to master the SDD lifecycle: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement.

## Core Principles
1. **No Manual Coding:** All code must be generated by Claude Code based on approved specifications.
2. **Predictability:** Every implementation step must map directly back to an explicit requirement in the specs.
3. **Clean Code:** Prioritize readability, modularity, and proper Python project structure (using `uv`).
4. **In-Memory Persistence:** For Phase I, state is maintained only during the application session.

## Technology Stack Constraints
- **Language:** Python 3.13+
- **Manager:** uv
- **Workflow Tools:** Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus

## Architecture Standards
- Use a clear separation between the UI (CLI) and the business logic (Task Manager).
- Implement standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Ensure type hinting is used throughout the source code.
